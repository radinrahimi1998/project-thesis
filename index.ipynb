These methods is  dictated the local intensity in micrograph by the position of atomic columns [@du_accuracy_2006] . Using images instead of diffraction offers high spatial resolution, but the field of view is limited [@mahr_theoretical_2015] . The shape of the measured lattice strain profiles can indicate artifacts depending on the selected imaging conditions. These artifacts arise from continuous contrast variations extending across several monolayers from the interface positions, caused by local crystal tilts in elastically relaxed specimens. Despite this, the average strain in thicker layers can be measured with adequate accuracy, providing a rough estimate of layer compositions when analyzing experimental micrographs  [@tillmann_impact_2000] ."

    "One method for measuring strain is the nano-beam electron diffraction (NBED) technique. This method uses a quasi-parallel electron beam with a diameter of less than 20 nm at full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a convergence semi-angle of less than 1 mrad. By analyzing shifts in the positions of the diffraction spots within the patterns, variations in the lattice parameters of the sample—and consequently the strain—can be determined [@beche_strain_2013]. This advance, that by using NBED it is possible to measure strain, has been made possible through the development of high-speed direct electron detectors, capable of capturing hundreds of thousands of diffraction patterns, which can then be analyzed to extract a wealth of detailed information. [@pekin_situ_2018]. Strain measurements obtained through NBED experiments are generally easier to analyze because the local strain precision does not rely on directly determining the position of atomic columns. As a result, the field of view is basically unlimited, allowing for the use of nearly any sample and orientation[@ophus_four-dimensional_2019].\n",
