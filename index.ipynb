    "### NBED\n",
    "One method for measuring strain is the nano-beam electron diffraction (NBED) technique. This method uses a quasi-parallel electron beam with a diameter of less than 20 nm at full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a convergence semi-angle of less than 1 mrad. By analyzing shifts in the positions of the diffraction spots within the patterns, variations in the lattice parameters of the sample—and consequently the strain—can be determined [@beche_strain_2013]. This advance, that by using NBED it is possible to measure strain, has been made possible through the development of high-speed direct electron detectors, capable of capturing hundreds of thousands of diffraction patterns, which can then be analyzed to extract a wealth of detailed information. [@pekin_situ_2018]. Strain measurements obtained through NBED experiments are generally easier to analyze because the local strain precision does not rely on directly determining the position of atomic columns. As a result, the field of view is basically unlimited, allowing for the use of nearly any sample and orientation[@ophus_four-dimensional_2019].\n",

    "Strain measurement using the locations of diffracted peaks is a well-established application of Bragg's law and has been successfully implemented through various experimental techniques.Accurate data collection is the first and most important phase in the Nanobeam Electron Diffraction(NBED) process. The sample must be placed near enough to the zone axis to enable illumination of several diffraction disks, although it need not be perfectly aligned.As shown schematically in  @fig-NBED3, a full diffraction pattern is recorded for every pixel in the reconstructed strain image. The locations of the diffraction disks are taken from these patterns and saved as subpixel-accurate coordinates in reciprocal space. Following the recording of every disk position, the local lattice vectors are computed using this data at every probe position by solving the system of linear  @eq-linear where B represents the reciprocal lattice matrix, L denotes the local lattice vectors, and  P corresponds to the measured disk positions..[@Pekin_Gammer_Ciston_Minor_Ophus_2017].\n",

    "### CBED\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular TEM method for measuring strain is Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED). Large diffraction disks are produced when the material is illuminated with a strongly convergent beam (semi-angle 5–20 mrad) with a probe size less than 2 nm, resulting in a CBED pattern. These disks have many characteristics for low-index zone axes that need to be simulated using dynamical theory. The transmitted disk shows sharp High Order Laue Zone (HOLZ) lines away from these axes. These lines' locations are extremely sensitive to lattice parameters, allowing for highly accurate strain measurements ($2^{-4}$).\n",
    "Hough transforms are used to determine the positions of sharp HOLZ lines, and then semi-kinematical computations are used to extract the lattice parameters. Analysis of expanded HOLZ lines, which are usually the result of defects or strain relaxation, requires trial-and-error modeling with coupled dynamical and finite element simulations or delicate fitting processes. Since all experimental profiles showed HOLZ line broadening, this method was employed in this investigation [@beche_strain_2013].\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer-assisted image analysis is crucial for quantitative assessment, improving precision and facilitating the automation of image processing activities. Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM) illustrates this automation by employing Kikuchi band detection in electron backscattering patterns to ascertain the orientations of individual grains. By automating this method, it becomes possible to evaluate thousands of patterns, resulting in detailed grain orientation maps. The Hough transform has been an essential instrument in these analyses, offering robust and noise-resistant automated band detection functionalities[@Krämer_Mayer_1999].\n",
    "\n",
    "First introduced by Paul Hough in 1962, the Hough transform was initially created for analyzing particle tracks in bubble chambers and represents one of the pioneering techniques for automating pattern recognition. In CBED patterns, there are fewer HOLZ lines to examine than Kikuchi bands in OIM, but the more distinct intensity distribution of HOLZ lines enables more accurate position determination. Nonetheless, current OIM software does not possess the precision needed for CBED analysis, which requires modifications to the Hough transform method to attain sub-pixel accuracy[@Krämer_Mayer_1999].\n",
