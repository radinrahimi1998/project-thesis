It is primarily based on the projected reciprocal lattice geometry that is extracted from electron diffraction spot patterns. Precession electron diffraction patterns are especially useful for this purpose. The required hardware allows for a scanning-precession movement of the primary electron beam on the crystalline sample and can be interfaced to any older or newer mid-voltage transmission electron microscope ({TEM}). Experimentally obtained crystal phase and orientation maps are shown for a variety of samples. Comprehensive commercial and open-access crystallographic databases may be used in support of the nanocrystal phase identification process and are briefly mentioned.},

Strain contrast in crystalline samples has always been one of the primary contrast mechanisms used for imaging the microstructure of a material in a transmission electron microscope ({TEM}). In this regard, {TEM} is a particularly powerful tool due to its ability to spatially resolve strain information with high precision and spatial resolution. This article reviews the techniques currently available for directly measuring strain in the {TEM}. Examples are given for measuring strain in semiconductor devices using imaging, diffraction, and holographic techniques. For strain measurement during in situ mechanical testing, two general methods are presented: the conversion of displacement from an actuation device or the direct measurement of strain using image features during deformation.},

The measured deformation by precession diffraction for the blanket films has been validated by comparison to energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry, X-Ray diffraction, and finite element simulations. We show that although the blanket films remain biaxially strained, the patterned fin structures are fully relaxed in the crystallographic planes that have been investigated.

The second is, through connection with the microscope scanning system, to map the local orientation of the specimen to investigate crystal texture, rotation and strain at the nanometre scale. This topical review brings the reader up to date, highlighting recent successes using {PED} and providing some pointers to the future in terms of method development and how the technique can meet some of the needs of the X-ray crystallography community. Complementary electron techniques are also discussed, together with how a synergy of methods may provide the best approach to electron-based structure analysis.},

	abstract = {Summary Lattice‐distortion analysis from high‐resolution transmission electron micrographs offers a convenient and fast tool for direct measurement of strains in materials over a large area. In the present work, we have evaluated the accuracy of the strain measurement when the effects of the realistic experimental variables are explicitly taken into account by the use of image simulation techniques. These variables are focal setting and variation, local thickness and orientation of the sample, as well as misalignments of the sample and the incident beam. The evaluation reveals that consistency of image features and contrast within the micrographs is desired for the analysis to eliminate effects of the variations of local focus value and specimen thickness. After proper orientation of a crystalline specimen, the misorientation of the object will not notably influence the strain measurement even though a local bending may exist within the sample. However, the incident beam of the microscope needs to be aligned carefully as the beam misalignment may introduce a notable artefact around the interface region.},

However, automatic and accurate diffraction analysis is still challenging due to noise and the complexity of intensity in diffraction patterns. In this work, we demonstrate an approach, employing the blob detection on cross-correlated diffraction patterns followed by a lattice fitting algorithm, to automate the processing of four-dimensional data, including identifying and locating disks, and extracting local lattice parameters without prior knowledge about the material. The approach is both tested using simulated diffraction patterns and applied on experimental data acquired from a Pd@Pt core-shell nanoparticle. Our method shows robustness against various sample thicknesses and high noise, capability to handle complex patterns, and picometer-scale accuracy in strain measurement, making it a promising tool for high-throughput 4D-STEM data processing.}, journal={Ultramicroscopy}, author={Wang, Sihan and Eldred, Tim B. and Smith, Jacob G. and Gao, Wenpei}, year={2022}, month=jun, pages={113513} }

The 2-D and 3-D Mohr circle representations of stresses are described, which can be used to interpret mechanical behaviors of rocks under stresses and depletion. Stress–strain governing equations are given for both elastic and poroelastic rocks with thermal effects. Rock anisotropic behaviors are investigated, and the constitutive equations for transversely isotropic and orthotropic rocks are presented. Considerations of anisotropy and poroelasticity play a very important role in understanding mechanical behaviors of rocks, particularly in shale oil and gas formations in which anisotropy and pore pressure are dominant characteristics. In situ stress equations accounting for anisotropy effects are also derived.}, booktitle={Applied Petroleum Geomechanics}, publisher={Gulf Professional Publishing}, author={Zhang, Jon Jincai}, editor={Zhang, Jon Jincai}, year={2019}, month=jan, pages={1–27} }

The HOLZ line positions are commonly used to measure the strain state in the investigated material. Besides the automation, a very important aspect is the accuracy of the detected line positions. The limits are determined by the amount of noise in the pattern relative to the contrast of the HOLZ lines and the line width. Our investigations show that sub-pixel resolution can be achieved routinely. We have also developed a new strain analysis procedure in which the dynamical shift of each individual line can be taken into account using a model based on several Ewald spheres with different radii. In comparison to the effective high voltage method, finer details of the dispersion surface can be considered, which increases the accuracy of the strain analysis. A measurement of the thermal expansion of aluminium is presented as a model experiment. The lattice constants were determined with an accuracy of about 10−4.}, number={1}, journal={Journal of Microscopy}, author={Krämer and Mayer}, year={1999}, pages={02–11}, language={en} }

Named “Absolute strain” (AbStrain), it allows for quantification and mapping of interplanar distances and angles, displacement fields and strain tensor components with reference to a user-defined Bravais lattice and with their corrections from the image distortions specific to HR-TEM and HR-STEM imaging. We provide the corresponding mathematical formalism. AbStrain goes beyond the restriction of the existing method known as geometric phase analysis by enabling direct analysis of the area of interest without the need for reference lattice fringes of a similar crystal structure on the same field of view. In addition, for the case of a crystal composed of two or more types of atoms, each with its own sub-structure constraint, we developed a method named “Relative displacement” for extracting sub-lattice fringes associated to one type of atom and measuring atomic columns displacements associated to each sub-structure with reference to a Bravais lattice or to another sub-structure. The successful application of AbStrain and Relative displacement to HR-STEM images of functional oxide ferroelectric heterostructures is demonstrated.}, journal={Ultramicroscopy}, author={Cherkashin, N. and Louiset, A. and Chmielewski, A. and Kim, D.J. and Dubourdieu, C. and Schamm-Chardon, S.}, year={2023}, month=nov, pages={113778}, language={en} }

The type of misfit dislocation at the interface was determined to be 60° dislocation and 90° full-edge dislocation. The full-field strains at the Ge/Si heterostructure interface were mapped by using the geometric phase analysis (GPA) and peak pairs analysis (PPA), respectively. The effect of the mask size on the GPA and PPA results was analyzed in detail. For comparison, the theoretical strain fields of the misfit dislocations were also calculated by the Peierls-Nabarro and Foreman dislocation models. The results showed that the optimal mask sizes in GPA and PPA were approximately three tenths and one-tenth of the reciprocal lattice vector, respectively. The Foreman dislocation model with an alterable factor a = 4 can best describe the strain field of the misfit dislocation at the Ge/Si heterostructure interface.}, number={66}, journal={Materials}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Li, Jijun and Zhao, Chunwang and Xing, Yongming and Su, Shaojian and Cheng, Buwen}, year={2013}, month=jun, pages={2130–2142}, language={en} }

By using a high-speed, direct electron detector, it is now possible to record a full two-dimensional (2D) image of the diffracted electron beam at each probe position, typically a 2D grid of probe positions. These 4D-STEM datasets are rich in information, including signatures of the local structure, orientation, deformation, electromagnetic fields, and other sample-dependent properties. However, extracting this information requires complex analysis pipelines that include data wrangling, calibration, analysis, and visualization, all while maintaining robustness against imaging distortions and artifacts. In this paper, we present py4DSTEM, an analysis toolkit for measuring material properties from 4D-STEM datasets, written in the Python language and released with an open-source license. We describe the algorithmic steps for dataset calibration and various 4D-STEM property measurements in detail and present results from several experimental datasets. We also implement a simple and universal file format appropriate for electron microscopy data in py4DSTEM, which uses the open-source HDF5 standard.
