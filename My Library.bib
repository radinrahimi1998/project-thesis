            An automated technique for the mapping of nanocrystal phases and orientations in a transmission electron microscope is described. It is primarily based on the projected reciprocal lattice geometry that is extracted from electron diffraction spot patterns. Precession electron diffraction patterns are especially useful for this purpose. The required hardware allows for a scanning-precession movement of the primary electron beam on the crystalline sample and can be interfaced to any older or newer mid-voltage transmission electron microscope ({TEM}). Experimentally obtained crystal phase and orientation maps are shown for a variety of samples. Comprehensive commercial and open-access crystallographic databases may be used in support of the nanocrystal phase identification process and are briefly mentioned.},

              The evolution of elastic strain engineering in nanostructures and devices requires characterization tools that can be used to not only observe but also quantify the actual strain in a sample, whether this strain is intrinsic or applied. Strain contrast in crystalline samples has always been one of the primary contrast mechanisms used for imaging the microstructure of a material in a transmission electron microscope ({TEM}). In this regard, {TEM} is a particularly powerful tool due to its ability to spatially resolve strain information with high precision and spatial resolution. This article reviews the techniques currently available for directly measuring strain in the {TEM}. Examples are given for measuring strain in semiconductor devices using imaging, diffraction, and holographic techniques. For strain measurement during
              in situ
              mechanical testing, two general methods are presented: the conversion of displacement from an actuation device or the direct measurement of strain using image features during deformation.},

The measured deformation by precession diffraction for the blanket films has been validated by comparison to energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry, X-Ray diffraction, and finite element simulations. We show that although the blanket films remain biaxially strained, the patterned fin structures are fully relaxed in the crystallographic planes that have been investigated.

            Lattice‐distortion analysis from high‐resolution transmission electron micrographs offers a convenient and fast tool for direct measurement of strains in materials over a large area. In the present work, we have evaluated the accuracy of the strain measurement when the effects of the realistic experimental variables are explicitly taken into account by the use of image simulation techniques. These variables are focal setting and variation, local thickness and orientation of the sample, as well as misalignments of the sample and the incident beam. The evaluation reveals that consistency of image features and contrast within the micrographs is desired for the analysis to eliminate effects of the variations of local focus value and specimen thickness. After proper orientation of a crystalline specimen, the misorientation of the object will not notably influence the strain measurement even though a local bending may exist within the sample. However, the incident beam of the microscope needs to be aligned carefully as the beam misalignment may introduce a notable artefact around the interface region.},
